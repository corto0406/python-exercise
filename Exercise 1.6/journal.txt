1. What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?

   - Databases are organized collections of structured data that are designed to efficiently store, manage,
     and retrieve information. They serve as a central repository for data and are essential in various software
     applications, from simple personal projects to large-scale enterprise systems. Databases are used to store
     data in a way that enables easy access, retrieval, and management.

2. List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:

   - VARCHAR: VARCHAR is a data type used to store variable-length character strings, such as text or alphanumeric
     data. It is commonly used for storing text-based data, such as names, descriptions, and other textual information.

   - INT: INT is a commonly used data type that stands for "integer." It is used to store whole numbers (positive, negative,
     or zero) and is one of the most fundamental data types for representing numerical data.

   - DATE: DATE data type is used to store date values. It represents a date in the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format

3. In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?

   - While both are database management systems, they do offer different services and features. SQLite is designed for single-user
     applications where there is no need for concurrent access by multiple users. If your application is not expected to have many
     concurrent connections, SQLite can be a more straightforward solution. SQLite is easy to set up and is a great choice for
     prototyping and testing purposes. You can quickly create and manipulate a SQLite database without the need for a separate
     database server. However, MySQL offers advanced features like stored procedures, triggers, and views that are not available
     in SQLite. If you need complex database logic, MySQL is a better option. Also, MySQL offers advanced features like stored procedures,
     triggers, and views that are not available in SQLite. If you need complex database logic, MySQL is a better option.

4. Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?

   - So far, I have to say that I enjoy coding with JavaScript more. Obviously it has to do with my experience in JavaScript versus Python,
     but some of the logic I have used to approach a problem in Python doesn't seem to work as expected. I also am not a big fan of the
     syntax. That being said, I am excited to keep working in Python to see if I can find the beauty in it.

5. Now that you're nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say are the limitations
   of Python as a programming language?

   - As of right now I cannot pinpoint any limitations as it is too early to say. A simple Google search suggests browser compatibility, slow
     performance as it is an interpreted language, and a limited ecosystem for front-end development. As we haven't touched base on any
     of this, I cannot say from my own experience that I have ran into these issues. However, during Excercise 1.5, I was trying to implement
     a private method in the Height class that would convert a height passed into it into inches which would then be used in the operator overloaded
     methods, but I could not get it to work. That was pretty frustrating.
